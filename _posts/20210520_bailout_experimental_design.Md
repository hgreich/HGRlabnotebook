# Lab notebook post on experimental design for the polyp bailout work and timepoints for the response variables
*Project rationale:* determine the recovery dynamics of Pocillopora acuta (and endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) following hyperosmotic-induced polyp bailout. An understanding of how exposure to acute hyperosmotic stress influences coral/algal physiology and energy budgets will better inform best practices for coral-on-a-chip experimental work.
