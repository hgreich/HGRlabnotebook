# Notes on changing the polyp bailout salinity ramp protocol for incubator experiments

| experiment setup | tank size (total) | start volume (L) | total vol added^ | # of doses | vol (mL) added each dose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6L minitank | 6L | 4L | 1.95L | 2/hr for 14h (28 total) | 60 mL |
| 2L cylinder | 2L | 1.2L | 0.75L | 2/hr for 14h (28 total) | 25 mL |

- ^two 14 hour dose periods are needed, pump is reprogrammed after 14 hours so tank can be siphoned and does not overflow.

Determined start and add vol for 2L cylinder tank based off of [protocol from previous experiment](https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Polyp_Bailout/PUTNAM_LAB_POLYP_BAILOUT_PROTOCOL.md) that used the 6L minitanks. Starting experiment with ~66% total tank vol and adding in the remaining 33% with 28 doses over 14 hours (25mL/dos, 50mL/hour, 700mL total).

### other notes
- goal is to change salinity ~0.85-1.1psu/hour
- adding volume conservatively (700mL total rather than 750mL to prevent overflow and account for discrepencies with jebao dosing pump calibration)
- jebao dosing pump was calibrated twice prior to the experiment. Pumps 1,3,4 had 95+% accuracy. Pump 2 was not consistent and not used for this round of experiments.
