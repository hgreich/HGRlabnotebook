# notes on preservation reqs and read absorbance for colorimetric assays

| Assay | read absorbance (nm) | preservation | reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| carbohydrate | 489 or 490 | -80C ^ | https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-carbohydrate-assay-for-96-well-plates-bvb9n2r6 |
| lipid | 540 | -80C ^ | https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-lipid-assay-for-96-well-plates-bvcfn2tn |
| chla | 630, 663, 750 | 4C, acetone | https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Polyp_Bailout/E5_phys_protocols/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md |
| protein | 562 | -40C | https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Polyp_Bailout/E5_phys_protocols/2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md |
| symbiont density | N/A | 4C, 1xPBS ^^ | https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Polyp_Bailout/E5_phys_protocols/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md |

- ^ Bove protocols have carb & lipid samples stored at -80C whereas the E5 airbrushing protocol has them stored at -40C
- ^^ could consider using xfiz for symbiont preservation https://jillashey.github.io/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/CoralHistology/
