# Welcome! This post is to describe how to visually "phenotype" Pocillopora Micropropagules following bailout.
## These morphology based "phenotypes" fall into four categories. Pictures and descriptions are below

### Recovered Polyps (abbreviation = RP)

Recovered polyps have some form of distinguishable morphology. This can include the presence of tentacles and oral-aboral polarization. Most frequently this includes seeing clusters of symbionts arranged in a flower/pinwheel of tentacles beneath the outside layer of the Micropropagule

### Degenerate Polyps (abbreviation = DP)
![degenerate_polyps](https://github.com/hgreich/HGR_Lab_Notebook/tree/master/images/20210118_degenerate_polyps)
Degenerate polyps are tissue balls without obvious distinguishable morphology features. This can include degenerate polyps covered in fleshy algae (these are relatively uncommon). **Residues of tentacles, coenosarc tissue, mesentary filaments, etc are not visible in degenerate polyps.**

### Unsure Polyps (abbreviation = UN)
![unsure_polyp](https://github.com/hgreich/HGR_Lab_Notebook/tree/master/images/20201210_unsure.jpg)
Unsure polyps fall into the category of pictures where no morphology features are distinguishable. **This is often due to photo issues**

### Swimming Larvae (abbreviation = SL)
![swimming_larvae](https://github.com/hgreich/HGR_Lab_Notebook/tree/master/images/20210119_swimming_larvae)
Swimming larvae are distinguishable by 1) an ovular shape with a subtle bifurcation at one end, 2) presence of brown endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, and 3) their swimming ability! These are rarely present immediately following bailout (usually 2+ days after)
