# Welcome! This post is to describe how to visually "phenotype" Pocillopora Micropropagules following bailout.
## These morphology based "phenotypes" fall into four categories. Pictures and descriptions are below

### Recovered Polyps (abbreviation = RP)

Recovered polyps have some form of distinguishable morphology. This can include the presence of tentacles and oral-aboral polarization. Most frequently this includes seeing clusters of symbionts arranged in a flower/pinwheel of tentacles beneath the outside layer of the Micropropagule

### Degenerated Polyps (abbreviation = DP)

Degenerated polyps are tissue balls without obvious distinguishable morphology features. This can include degenerated polyps covered in fleshy algae (these are relatively uncommon). **Residues of tentacles, coenosarc tissue, mesentary filaments, etc are not visible in degenerate polyps.**

### Unsure Polyps (abbreviation = UN)
![unsure_polyp](https://github.com/hgreich/HGRlabnotebook/blob/master/images/micropropagule_phenotyping/unsure_polyp_example.png)
Unsure polyps fall into the category of pictures where no morphology features are distinguishable. **This is often due to photo issues**

### Flatworms look very similar to swimming larvae

Unfortunately they are not swimming larvae and need to be removed (via bulb pipette immediately)
