# Cell yield following liberase enzyme digestion for bleached coral frags and an almost polyp bailout coral frag

### Background
Did several liberase digestions. wanted to determine whether liberase digestions are more effective in harvesting higher coral cell yields than trypsin digestions

### Samples
- poc 8-13 arrived from Ocean State Aquatics on 9/2/2020. they are pigmented, fluffy, and happy!
- adjusted light levels... at 5% of all myAI parameters.

### Protocol
- cell isolation using mechanical scraping and a 0.05 liberase digestion. cell counting with hemocytometer [this protocol](https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Culturing/Cell_Isolation_Protocol.md)
- changes made to protocol: only suspended with 1 mL 0.05 liberase. liberase digestion was 20 min instead of 10 min. following centrifugation neutralized liberase with 1 mL coral culture media

### prelim findings on trypsin versus liberase comparisons
- markdown and data file here. has comparisons between trypsin and liberase digestions cell yields [private until submission](https://github.com/hgreich/CnidCellCulture/blob/master/markdown_files/09012020_liberase_cell_yields.Md)
