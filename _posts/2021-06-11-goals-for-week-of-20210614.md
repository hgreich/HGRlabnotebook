# Goals for week of 20210614
bailout trial for AT training and settlement optimization
- *control, ambient salinity* n=2 plastic containers with n=3 bailout chambers (one ~1cm frag per chamber, total of 6 control)
- *hyperosmotic stress treatment* n=2 plastic containers with n=3 bailout chambers (one ~1cm frag per chamber, total of 6 control)
- settlement treatments will have n=20 micropropagules per well. Wells will be replenished with 1mL filtered seawater everyday.
- settlement substrate will be microscope coverslips and waterproof paper. If enough micropropagules are available we will include  microscope coverslips with red tape. The pieces of waterproof paper provided as settlement substrate will be the same size as the microscope coverslips.

| day | goal |
| --- | --- |
| monday | pump setup, move apex into incubator, start experiment, T-0 photos and water quality |
| tuesday | T-1 photos and water quality, remove 1L from containers with siphon, reprogram pump |
| wednesday | count micropropagules, count corallites, image and phenotyping (if time), start settlement treatments |
| thursday | check for settlement, micropropagule imaging and phenotyping (if time) |
| friday | check for settlement, micropropagule imaging and phenotyping, feed well plates  |

***we will rotate tank and 6well plate configuration everyday to account for variation in light intensity***

Other potential tasks
- filtering more Seawater
- continue AT onboarding with water quality and github
