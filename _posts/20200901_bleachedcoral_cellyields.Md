# Cell yield following trypsin enzyme digestion for bleached coral frags and an almost polyp bailout coral frag

### Background
Prelim observations suggest pale *Pocillopora damicornis* have higher cnidarian cell yield and lower algal cell yields. Most of our coral fragments have been sub-fragged several times and have either 1) completely bleached or 2) were about to polyp bailout. Wanted to determine what cell yields would look like for these two "timepoints" during their "journey to a different reef"

### Samples
- poc-3 was about to polyp bailout. used two sub-frags.
- poc-4 and poc-6 were completely bleached. used two sub-frags from each colony

### look how stressed they were
all fragments

### Protocol
- cell isolation using mechanical scraping and a 0.025 trypsin digestion following. cell counting with hemocytometer [this protocol](https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/SynCoral_Protocols/blob/master/Culturing/Cell_Isolation_Protocol.md)

### prelim findings
- markdown and data file here [private until submission](https://github.com/hgreich/CnidCellCulture/blob/master/markdown_files/09012020_bailout_bleached_coral_cell_yields.Md)

### next steps
attempting cell harvests from bleached corals was not a great use of time. almost polyp bailout corals did have high cell yields but also had a lot of debris. will move forward with liberase and trypsin digestions with new corals following their arrival tomorrow
