# this post is the sequel to an [earlier post about incubator setup](https://hgreich.github.io/HGRlabnotebook/protocols/2021/06/01/Incubator_Setup_Notes.html) planning
## the previous post (part I) was for note taking on incubator dimensions and potential tank configuration
## this post describes the 'final' configuration. This includes light, temperature, and tank/carboy configuration

***All containers with water (carboys, bailout tanks, 6well plates) are kept in plastic bins to prevent flooding. All plastic bins are white so bin color (and potential changes in light reflected) is constant among treatments. All electronics are on the top shelf to prevent water damage.***
*Pictures below*

# temperature - set to ~28.5C (results in ~26.5C water temp inside tanks which is similar to the water tables)

# Light (2 hydra AI 52 lights)
- Had to factory reset lights (recommended when moving lights from one tank to another)

## Parameters-Ramp-Schedule
*note: want to keep light constant for settlement experiments but the 10min ramp was the shortest option*
- Morning Ramp: 6am-6:10am
- Peak: 6:10am-6pm
- Evening Ramp: 6pm-6:10pm

## Light-Settings

*Lights were set so that the light levels near the 6 well settlement plates and the bailout containers is 30-40 umol/m2/s. Info on water table light conditions [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/CBLS_Wetlab_Protocols/20210527_Water_Table_Light_Protocol.md).*

|Type of light | Percent - top light | Percent - bottom light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UV | 3% | 2% |
| Violet | 3% | 2% |
| Royal | 3% | 2% |
| Blue | 3% | 2% |
| Green | 3% | 2% |
| Deep Red | 3% | 2% |
| Cool Light | 3% | 2% |
| Moon Light | 3% | 2% |

## Carboys
Two 2-gallon carboys are on the bottom shelf in a plastic bin. One carboy has mixing tank seawater (~32.5psu, not from the recirculating tanks so elemental composition is known). The high salinity carboy has mixing tank seawater with extra Fritz RPM salt so the salinity is adjusted to ~78psu. Seawater from both was filtered over a 0.22um filter.

## Tanks for Bailout
- 2L clear, circular plastic containers (height: 10in, diameter: 4.25in)

## Mesh bailout chambers
- Plastic salad dressing to-go cups with 150um mesh holes in the bottom and 3 around the side. After the mesh was hot glued onto the plastic the chambers were soaked in water for 30min so leachate is completed before they come in contact with corals.

***Lessons learned during bailout chamber construction***
- small lengths (~1in) of pvc and plastic tubing (~1in diameter) sank. We had some success floating these with egg crate (taped some of the small squares and the perimeter of the egg crate to improve buoyancy but the egg crate took up too much space which would allow for fewer bailout chambers/tank). We opted not to float pvc or plastic tubing with styrofoam to prevent contamination. Wrapping aquarium tubing around the plastic or pvc as "floaties" did not work either (both ends of the plastic tubing were taped over to prevent flooding).

# Plan for week of 20210614
bailout trial for AT training and settlement optimization
- *control, ambient salinity* n=2 plastic containers with n=3 bailout chambers (one ~1cm frag per chamber, total of 6 control)
- *hyperosmotic stress treatment* n=2 plastic containers with n=3 bailout chambers (one ~1cm frag per chamber, total of 6 control)
- settlement treatments will have n=20 micropropagules per well. Wells will be replenished with 1mL filtered seawater everyday.
- settlement substrate will be microscope coverslips and waterproof paper. If enough micropropagules are available we will include  microscope coverslips with red tape. The pieces of waterproof paper provided as settlement substrate will be the same size as the microscope coverslips.

| day | goal |
| --- | --- |
| monday | pump setup, move apex into incubator, start experiment, T-0 photos and water quality |
| tuesday | T-1 photos and water quality, remove 1L from containers with siphon, reprogram pump |
| wednesday | count micropropagules, count corallites, image and phenotyping (if time), start settlement treatments |
| thursday | check for settlement, micropropagule imaging and phenotyping (if time) |
| friday | check for settlement, micropropagule imaging and phenotyping, feed well plates  |

***we will rotate tank and 6well plate configuration everyday to account for variation in light intensity***
