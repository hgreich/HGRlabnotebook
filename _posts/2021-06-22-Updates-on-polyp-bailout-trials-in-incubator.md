# update on polyp bailout trials in incubator
- Photos of colonies and water quality in *private* [polyp bailout repo](https://github.com/thesyntheticcoral/PolypBailoutExpt)
- info on salinity ramp changes to optimize experiments for smaller tanks, [lab notebook post here](https://hgreich.github.io/HGRlabnotebook/protocols/2021/06/14/Changing-polyp-bailout-salinity-ramp-protocol-for-incubator-experiments.html)

### notes on trial started 20210614
- used n=3 fragments for control and n=3 fragments for salinity ramp. all fragments from coral 0045, info in [CBLS coral database](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/tree/master/Lab_Resourses/CBLS_Coral_Database)
- initially had aquarium pumps in 2L containers but they would heat up containers by ~5C (water temp would get to 32.5C) so they were removed. Using oxygen bubblers for 20210621 trials to create water flow (and oxygenate water)
- jebao pump interval "P# Interval Day" was initially set to 2 (can select between 0-30 days). We thought this would program it to carry out the pumping schedule for 2 days but it actually means every other day. Because of this the 2nd set of 24 doses was delayed by 24hr (reprogrammed pump with P# Interval Day = 0 on weds 20210616 which run program everyday). This meant that the corals spent an extra 24hours at 43psu
- jebao pump protocol in [AT labnotebook](https://atho1803.github.io/AT_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Jebao-Dosing-Pump-Protocol/)
- **For these reasons (temperature and salinity ramp inconsistencies), we won't incorporate the data from this trial into any manuscripts but continued for training purposes**
- two of the salinity treatment corals had 100% bailout once exposed to 54psu (final salinity after ramp). The third fragment had 100% bailout the day after (i.e., after an additional 24hrs at 54psu)
- there was nearly a 1:1 relationship of micropropagules released:corallites

##### settlement notes
- microscope coverslips are very difficult to remove from the clear 6well settlement plates (both are clear, this is slightly more feasible with red tape on the cover slip)
- water did not evaporate from wells over weekend
- daily water change = remove 3-4mL from well, add 1-2mL 0.22um filtered seawater (so well is nearly full)
- difficult to detect settlement using dissecting scope
- compound scope gave better resolution, will want to try putting piece of waterproof paper in sedgwick-rafter  counting chamber to get a better focus (previously used petri dishes)
- could see what looked like "potential settlement" with naked eye but looked more like decomposed tissue on paper when viewing under the compound scope

### notes on trial started 20210621
- used n=4 fragments for control and n=4 fragments for salinity ramp. all fragments from coral 0047, info in [CBLS coral database](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/tree/master/Lab_Resourses/CBLS_Coral_Database)
- adding in water bubblers for both tanks helped with water pH
- programmed 1st day of dosing to add 30 mL because last week's trial did not reach 60psu. Wound up overshooting desired salinity increase by 8psu (elicited 20psu increase, ~12 is ideal)
- programmed 2nd day of dosing to add 17 mL to avoid another 20psu increase (~6psu increase would be ideal)

### salinity ramp info (both trials, for salinity treatment)

- 20210614 starting salinity = 78.67psu
- 20210621 starting salinity = 79.96psu
